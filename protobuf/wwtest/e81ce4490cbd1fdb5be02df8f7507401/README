The first line of this file is intentionally easy to parse for various
interactive scripting and debugging purposes.  But please DO NOT write programs
that exploit it, as they will be broken by design: it is not possible to
reverse engineer the set of source trees or the --package_path from the output
tree, and if you attempt it, you will fail, creating subtle and
hard-to-diagnose bugs, that will no doubt get blamed on changes made by the
Bazel team.

This directory was generated by Bazel.
Do not attempt to modify or delete any files in this directory.
Among other issues, Bazel's file system caching assumes that
only Bazel will modify this directory and the files in it,
so if you change anything here you may mess up Bazel's cache.
