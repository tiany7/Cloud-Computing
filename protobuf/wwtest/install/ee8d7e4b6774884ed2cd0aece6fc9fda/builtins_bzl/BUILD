# The .bzl files in this directory are used by Bazel itself, and should not be
# modified or copied into a Bazel workspace. Aside from not being a stable
# interface, they use a modified dialect of Bazel's Build Language and cannot be
# loaded as regular .bzl files.
#
# Bazel developers: This directory is used whenever "%install_base%" is passed
# to --experimental_builtins_bzl_path. See StarlarkBuiltinsFunction.java and
# BzlLoadFunction.java for more information.
